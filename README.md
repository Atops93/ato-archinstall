My own arch install script to make life easier while setting up arch the way I like it. Normal `archinstall` is ass. EXTREAMLY BUGGY!

### Install
Cloning the script on a live arch iso: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Atops93/archinstall`

cd into directory:
`cd ato-archinstall`

### Choosing the bootloader.
Run `./arch-grub.sh` to install grub.

Run `./arch-systemd-boot.sh` to install systemd.
