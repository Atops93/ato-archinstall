My own arch install script to make life easier while setting up arch the way I like it. Normal `archinstall` is ass & EXTREAMLY BUGGY from my experience. However this script was meant to be designed just for me, I didn't intend this script to be for other users. If you want to use it idc its on github anyways.

### Install
Cloning the script on a live arch iso: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Atops93/archinstall`

cd into directory:
`cd archinstall`

### Choosing the bootloader.
Run `./arch-grub.sh` to install grub.

Run `./arch-systemd-boot.sh` to install systemd.
